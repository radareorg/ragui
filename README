RADARE GUI
==========

Brainstorm

* Rename to RIDE?
  RIDE /raid/

* All widgets must be retiled by keybindings, like in dwm
  - tabs can be detached
  - tabs can contain graphs, code, zoomed view ...
  - code can be edited if write mode enabled
* statusbar shows active opened file information (rwx, ..)
  - do we really need it?


Projects
========
- use sqlite?
- use rdb?
