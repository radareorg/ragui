* Project types: 
  - Forensics
    * need to add API's to read/write any filesystem
      - interface for Linux kernel code into userland FUSE-like api?
  - Static analysis
  - Debugger
  - Bindiffing
* Add notepad widget (left panel)

  RIDE /raid/

* All widgets must be retiled by keybindings, like in dwm
  - tabs can be detached
  - tabs can contain graphs, code, zoomed view ...
  - code can be edited if write mode enabled
* statusbar shows active opened file information (rwx, ..)
