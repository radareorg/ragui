* Keybindings configuration
  - define global, wm, per-widget actions
* If passing a directory to ragui, just open it and ask for file
* Debugger panel? where?
  - allow to move panels from top to down
* Templates for data
  - add tab in main window to display templated data (pm)

TODO
* In Grabin.All the RBin must be updateable.. else we cannot
  load more than one file in a session
* rarc2 widget 
  - left panel code, right panel asm
  - downside a list of bytes

* configurable keybindings to run r2 commands
* Running visual command in gui makes gui useless
  - we have to be able to disable visual mode
* Bar clickable, combobox to select file or map range
* Implement attach to process and debug
* Use parvala in grabin Makefile

BUGS
* Fix grava delta produced by zoom

to debug:
export G_DEBUG=fatal_warnings

* Project types: 
  - Forensics
    * need to add API's to read/write any filesystem
      - interface for Linux kernel code into userland FUSE-like api?
  - Static analysis
  - Debugger
  - Bindiffing
* Add notepad widget (left panel)
* Rename to RIDE?
  RIDE /raid/

* All widgets must be retiled by keybindings, like in dwm
  - tabs can be detached
  - tabs can contain graphs, code, zoomed view ...
  - code can be edited if write mode enabled
* statusbar shows active opened file information (rwx, ..)
  - do we really need it?
